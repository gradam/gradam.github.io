## About

> The code is just a tool, but still, you have to know how to use it.

I help people (and sometimes myself) make ideas come true. I've been doing it for over half a decade now! Technologies such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://python.org">Python</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> were very helpful along the way. 

I am passionate about entrepreneurship, startups, new technologies and sharing knowledge. I am a mentor for several aspiring programmers and ex-mentor for some that have become mentors themselves.

In my career, I worked with clients from all around the world, mostly in small, self-organized teams or as a team leader. I've worked as a freelancer, Co-founder and employee both for product companies and software houses.
